## 🌳 Understanding Your Carbon Forest

### Tree Growth Formula
- **1 tree = 21 kg CO₂ saved** (scientifically accurate)
- Trees appear as you complete challenges
- Watch your forest grow over time
- Partial progress shows as a glowing, growing tree

### What It Means
- **1 tree** = ~21 kg CO₂ absorbed per year
- **10 trees** = ~210 kg CO₂ (equivalent to 525 km not driven)
- **50 trees** = ~1,050 kg CO₂ (equivalent to a transatlantic flight offset)
