# ⚡ Quick Start: Geospatial Scanner

## 🎯 You Now Have TWO Scanner Modes!

###  **OLD**: Abstract 3D (Still available)
- Floating objects in empty space
- Good for learning Three.js/AR concepts

### 🌍 **NEW**: Geospatial 3D (10X Feature)
- Real 3D terrain and buildings
- Air quality heatmap on actual streets
- Track routes on real map
- Challenges at real locations

---

## 🚀 To Use Geospatial Mode:

### Step 1: Add Mapbox Token
Create `.env` file in project root:
```bash
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NXVycTA2emYycXBndHRqcmZ3N3gifQ.rJcFIG214AriISLbB6B5aw
```

*This is a demo token. For production, get your own at [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)*

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C if running)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test It!
1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click **Scanner** tab
3. Click the **🌍 NEW** button (blue, glowing)
4. See real 3D map with environmental data!

## 🎮 What You Can Do Now

### In Geospatial Mode:
- ✅ **Pan**: Click + drag
- ✅ **Rotate**: Right-click + drag
- ✅ **Zoom**: Scroll wheel
- ✅ **Tilt**: Ctrl + drag
- ✅ **3D Hexagons**: Air quality (height = pollution level)
- ✅ **Green dots**: Parks and green spaces
- ✅ **Blue dot**: Your location
- ✅ **Route tracking**: Start tracking button at bottom

### Toggle Layers:
- **Air Quality** button → Show/hide pollution heatmap
- **Leaf** button → Show/hide green spaces
- More layers coming in Phase 2!

## 🔄 Switch Between Modes Anytime

**Scanner tab now has 5 modes:**
1. 🌍 **Geospatial** (NEW! - Real 3D map)
2. 🔲 **3D** (Original - Abstract space)
3. 🎯 **Challenges** (Interactive missions)
4. 🏆 **Impact** (Your stats dashboard)
5. 📋 **List** (Simple list view)

Just click the buttons in the header!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Mapbox Token Required" screen
→ Make sure `.env` file exists with `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=...`
→ Restart dev server after creating `.env`

### Map not loading
→ Check browser console for errors
→ Try the demo token provided above

### Location not showing
→ Allow location permissions in browser
→ Works best on HTTPS (localhost is fine)

### 3D hexagons not appearing
→ Wait a few seconds for air quality API
→ Check console for API errors
→ Toggle Air Quality button off/on

## 💡 What Makes This Revolutionary?

### Other Apps:
- "You saved 2.5 kg CO₂" → Just a number

### Your App Now:
- "You saved 2.5 kg CO₂ by walking Main St instead of Industrial Ave"
- → Shows your actual green route on 3D map
- → Compares air quality of streets you chose
- → Proves your impact with visual evidence

**That's the difference between abstract and actionable!** 🌍💚
